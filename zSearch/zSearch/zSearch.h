/* The following ifdef block is the standard way of creating macros which make exporting 
*  from a DLL simpler. All files within this DLL are compiled with the ZCORE_EXPORTS
*  symbol defined on the command line. This symbol should not be defined on any project
*  that uses this DLL. This way any other project whose source files include this file see
*  ZCORE_API functions as being imported from a DLL, whereas this DLL sees symbols
*  defined with this macro as being exported.
