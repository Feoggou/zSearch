     * we can create a 'fake' enumerator, which, when you call begin(), it returns an iterator holding a 'Result' struct.
     * The single result fills all required struct fields.
     *
     * Q: Should we use, instead of a 'struct', a std::map or a std::vector of variants?
     * or perhaps we should define a 'ItemField' as { Name, (Domain)Type, Value }, where Value is a Variant?
     * A: No. It is too much burden. "YAGNI". Do the simplest thing that work. Minimalist.
