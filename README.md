# zSearch
Building a cross-platform search application, based on the in progress cross platform library zLib.

Objectives:
- Exercise / practice TDD.
- Learn & understand more of Linux API.
- Do not use Qt.

The objective of this project is not to reach a fully-functional application for possible end users to enjoy.

By this, the functionality of the old SearchApp (https://github.com/Feoggou/searchapp) will be rewritten, in a more professional manner.

A previous attempt of rewriting that project had been https://github.com/Feoggou/old.zSearch, which was finally abandoned because its development strayed too much on the "design upfront" path.
