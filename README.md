# zSearch
Building a cross-platform search application, based on the in progress cross platform library zLib.

Objectives:
- Exercise / practice TDD.
- Learn & understand more of Linux API.
- Do not use Qt.

The objective of this project is not to reach a fully-functional application for possible end users to enjoy.

By this I'm going to rewrite the functionality of the old SearchApp
https://github.com/Feoggou/searchapp

in a more professional manner.
